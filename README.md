# matrixMultiplication

This program uses threads to multiply two matrices together concurrently. You can specify how many threads are used for the calculations and you can create your own matrices for the calculations. I've provided some example matrices. To switch between small, medium, and large matrices just uncomment the selection you want inside of "matmul.h". I will say, the program gets a little glitchy with larger matrices and may not perform correctly.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./matmul "number of threads"
